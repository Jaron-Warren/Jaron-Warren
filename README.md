Hello
My name is Jaron Warren. Currently attending a bootcamp at Boise code works. I come from a background of suporting technology in education. I am learning to become a fullstack developer. I love the challenge software development brings, along with all of it's possibilities!

I enjoy:
- Outdoor adventures 👓🎒🥾 (hiking, camping, hunting)
- PC games 👨🏽‍💻 (board games too)
- time with wife 💑 (and family)
